# CPU
Custom 8-Bit CPU Design

## About

This project aims to design a basic 8-Bit CPU from the fundamental digital logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).

## Logisim

The circuitry is designed in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). This software also simulates the runtime of the CPU and allows you to explore the entire design of the CPU's circuitry.

Subcomponents of the CPU such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit and Control Unit are organised into labeled subcircuits that you can further explore.

You can downlaod Logisim from [http://www.cburch.com/logisim/](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and use it to open CPU.circ.

## Programming the CPU

The Compiler/compiler.html web app is a programming environment to write software for this CPU. The web app includes a color coded text editor, reference sheet, compiler, and an emulator to test programms. The code is written in a custom variation of assembly code that is taylored to this CPU.
